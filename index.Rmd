# Welcome{-}

Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++ because it is implemented to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for ease of use. Anyone can get a high-performance outcome.

This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain the usage of Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.

I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me any feedback on this document.
